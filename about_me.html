      <h3>Finding a new calling</h3>
      <p>
        At the end of 2021 i discovered a new hobby. "Computer Stuff". I was
        hooked! There is so much more then just "Computer Stuff". I started
        doing courses on Udemy, watching videos on YouTube, reading all sorts of
        new information. Eventually it got to the point where i decided to
        switch teams, aka change carriere. There is so much growth and
        opportunities in the IT field, and i want to be a part of it.

      <h4>Working Out</h4>
      <p>So, working out helped me a lot. More mentally then physically. I've suffered depression, stress, losing friends and family.. What gym means for me personally is something i can't explain. If i don't workout, all those past thoughts come back, and it feels like shit honestly</p>

      <p>"Jeez are you still playing videogames? You are like what, 25? Grow up". <br> 
      Well, yes Megan i still play videogames. English is not my native language. Guess where i learned English, that's right, videogames. i learned more about history playing Uncharted than in any classroom.</p>

      <h4>Coding/Programming</h4>
      <p>
        My newfound hobby, coding/programming. I'm super new in this field,
        eventhough i spent most of my time watching and reading all sorts of IT
        literature, just to broad my view on things. There is so much that i can
        learn its crazy!
